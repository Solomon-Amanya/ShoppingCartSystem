The system should let users park their car in a parking lot and also let users retrieve their
car from a parking lot.

The business has 10 floors with each floor having 50 parking spots. The system should only let
users park their car if a parking lot of a given floor is not 90% full.
The system will also notify the business owner if the parking lot of a given floor is full so they
can open the parking lot on the next floor.

However, if the parking lot usage of any given floor stays at only 20% capacity for more than 6 hours,

the system should also notify the owner so they donâ€™t have to worry about opening the parking space of
other floors.
